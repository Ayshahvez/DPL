here i will demonstrate how to perform interopability between VB script and C/C++ environment.

NOTE....................................................................................
The square folder contain project used to build square.DLL function file
The squareC++ folder contain project used to build squareC++.DLL function file
The "DLLfiles" folder contain the executable DLL files for square function written in C and C++.
The "square.dll" file was written in C
The "squareC++.dll" file was written in C++
Both DLL files were created when the function were build and compiled respectively
...........................................................................................

squareFunct.xlsb file
1. open the squareFunct.xlsb file.....
2.if it says to enable macro then do so
3.then you can use squareonWorksheet function to find square of any number...

WELCOME button-> just welcomes user
Higher button ->just increment the value in cell e3 by 1
Lower button ->just decrement the value in cell e3 by 1
Duplicate -> duplicate "Data" worksheet
Delete-> delete all sheets except "Data" worksheet

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
arraysFunct.xlsb
1. open the arraysFunct.xlsb file.....
2.if it says to enable macro then do so
3.then you can see for yourself the fast run time execution of a array function written in C...
4.use the macro testUseArray to carry out the opereration

IMPORTANT NOTES..............
*if it says to enable macro then do so
*the squareonWorksheet function in excel was written in the C environment 
*the squareonWorksheett function in excel was written in the C++ environment
